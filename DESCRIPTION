Description: Performs genome-wide association analyses using the FarmCPU model.
    Briefly, FarmCPU tests the significance of associations between genetic markers
    and phenotypes using the general linear model framework. After single-marker
    regression, FarmCPU divides the genome into bins and identifies a set of optimal
    markers to use as covariates in the next iteration. This approach, similar to
    that of the multi-locus mixed model, increases power and decreases the false
    discovery rate.
